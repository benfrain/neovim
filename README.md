# Neovim config

This is my day to day configuration for Neovim. I work as a front-end developer, using languages like CSS, JavaScript (and their superset equivalents like Sass and TypeScript) and HTML.

This is the config I use on YouTube: https://youtube.com/@benfrainuk

These files live in the `.config/nvim` folder of my user directory.
